      "post": "Vue is famous for its intuitive design and shallow learning curve. This means itâ€™s easy to train staff in, even non-frontend devs and designers.Since developers will be up-and-running with Vue quickly, training costs will be kept to a minimum.Vue provides a powerful solution for complex single-page applications but also scales down nicely for smaller projects where only basic page functionality needs to be added.",

Their friends, likes and dislikes, relationship status, phone number, address, everything. Sounds a little dangerous.
